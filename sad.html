        <h1>Tonight</h1>
        <h5>by: FM Static</h5>
        <p>
            I remember the times we spent together on those drives <br>
            We had a million questions all about our lives<br>
            And when we got to New York, everything felt right<br>
            I wish you were here with me tonight<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember the days we spent together were not enough<br>
            And it used to feel like dreaming except we always woke up<br>
            Never thought not having you here now would hurt so much<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up<br>
            I need your loving hands to come and pick me up<br>
            And every night I miss you I can just look up<br>
            And know the stars are holding you, holding you, holding you tonight<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember the time you told me about when you were eight<br>
            And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait<br>
            I remember the car you were last seen in and the games we would play<br>
            All the times we spilled our coffees and stayed out way too late<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember the time you sat and told me about your Jesus<br>
            And how not to look back even if no one believes us<br>
            When it hurts so bad sometimes not having you here<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I sing<br>
            Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up<br>
            I need your loving hands to come and pick me up<br>
            And every night I miss you I can just look up<br>
            And know the stars are holding you, holding you, holding you tonight<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I sing<br>
            Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up<br>
            I need your loving hands to come and pick me up<br>
            And every night I miss you I can just look up<br>
            And know the stars are holding you, holding you, holding you tonight<br>
        </p>
