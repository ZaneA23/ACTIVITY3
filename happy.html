            It might seem crazy what I'm about to say <br>
            Sunshine she's here, you can take a break <br>
            I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space <br>
            With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way <br>
            uh <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            (Because I'm happy)<br>
            Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof <br>
            (Because I'm happy)<br>
            Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth <br>
            (Because I'm happy)<br>
            Clap along if you know what happiness is to you <br>
            (Because I'm happy)<br>
            Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do <br>
        </p>

            Here come bad news, talking this and that (Yeah!) <br>
            Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back (Yeah!) <br>
            Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine (Yeah!) <br>
            No offense to you <br>
            Don't waste your time, here's why <br>
        </p>
